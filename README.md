ebook_avant_garde
=================

A series of EPUB widgets (http://www.idpf.org/epub/widgets/) for the development of avant-garde ebook content:

# Invisible Eink

Swipe/mouse over the whitespace in the excerpt from <em>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> to reveal the rest of the story

# CSI: EPUB

Click/tap anywhere on a text excerpt of <em>Bartleby, the Scrivener</em>, and see the evidence left behind.

# Math.random(Shakespeare)

Click/tap the &#x201c;Randomize content!&#x201d; button over and over to scramble and re-scramble the lines of a famous passage from <em>Hamlet</em>.

Each subdirectory contains a .epub Widget file, as well as its component HTML/JS.

Also, you can <a href="https://github.com/sandersk/ebook_avant_garde/raw/master/ebook_avant_garde.epub">download a full EPUB</a> containing all three avant-garde examples.
